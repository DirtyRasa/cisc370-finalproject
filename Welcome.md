# Introduction #

This project is for school where the program needs to connect to the network. We have chosen to create an online poker application.


# Details #

The first step of our program will be to implement Blackjack as a stand alone console based application.
From there, we will be able to add the networking capabilities so that multiple players can join the same game.
Then we will start adding the "Bells and Whistles" which includes
  * Betting
  * Graphics
    * Log in/Register page
    * Select which game to play
    * Pick a table to sit down
    * A table with a max of 6 players
    * Show for each player
      * Cards
      * Total money
  * More games
